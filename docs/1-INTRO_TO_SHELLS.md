# Intro to Shells
## What is a shell?
A Shell is a program that allows users to interact with a computers operating system. There can be command-line shells, and graphical shells. For this guide, we will be working exclusively with command-line shells (which is what BASH is!).

```bash
mitch@server:/tmp$ echo "Hello"
Hello
```

Above is an example of what interacting with a shell looks like. This snippet is an example from an Ubuntu 22.10 Server.

In the above example, `mitch` is the username, and `server` is the hostname. `/tmp` is the current directory. `echo "Hello"` is the command being ran, and the results can be seen at the next line.
