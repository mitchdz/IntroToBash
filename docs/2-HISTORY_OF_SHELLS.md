### History of shells
#### Thompson shell (1971)
The very first Unix shell, introduced in 1971.

---

#### The Bourne Shell (1977)
The bourne shell was the default shell in version 7 of unix. This shell is still present in many systems at `/bin/sh`. The Bourne Shell supercedes the Thompson shell.

---

#### Bash (Bourne Again Shell) (1989)
This is the shell this workshop is all about! Bash was made to replace the Bourne shell, and has remained the default shell for many Linux distributions.

#### zsh
Default shell on macs now. zsh is built on top of bash, so includes many of the features this guide will talk about, including some extra helpful features.

A popular project called `oh my zsh` maintains zsh themes (this is what I use on my systems :))
